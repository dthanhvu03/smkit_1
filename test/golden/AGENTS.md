# Golden Fixture — agent instructions (AGENTS.md)

Mode: vibe — move fast, talk in plain language, keep the codebase consistent. Guardrails are always on.

Read the Constitution (.kit/constitution.md) and Decision Log (.kit/decisions.md) before coding.

# Hard rules — always apply, every turn

1. **Guardrails never off.** Never run destructive commands (see the blocklist). They are blocked in every mode; you may propose alternatives, never bypass.
2. **Read the project memory before coding.** At session start you are given the Constitution and Decision Log. Follow them. Do not re-decide something already decided there.
3. **Consistency first.** Reuse existing patterns, names, folders, and libraries. Do NOT introduce a second way to do something that already has a way. If you must, STOP and ask in plain language.
4. **Record decisions.** When you make a non-trivial technical choice (a library, a structure, a naming convention), append it to the Decision Log so future sessions stay consistent.
5. **Match the mode.** `vibe` = move fast, minimal ceremony, talk to the user in plain (non-technical) language. `standard` = brief + self-review + tests. `strict` = full gate chain + human approval for schema/prod/data.
6. **Approvals are real.** For anything listed under `approvers` (schema change, prod deploy, data delete), stop and get sign-off unless the approver list is empty (self-approve).
7. **Secrets stay out of chat and code.** Never paste real secrets, `.env` files, tokens, production data, or customer info into the prompt (use placeholders), and never commit them. If a secret is exposed, tell the user to **rotate** it — deleting the text is not enough.

# Routing — propose the fitting command, don't make the user memorize

The user talks in plain language and should never have to know which slash command to use. When they describe a goal **without** naming a command, silently classify the intent, then **propose the fitting command in one plain sentence and confirm** before running it. Say what the command does in the user's terms, not jargon. If they already typed a command, respect it.

Intent → command:

| What the user is really asking for | Propose | 
|---|---|
| First use / the constitution is still placeholders | `/onboard` — read the project & fill setup |
| Deliver a whole feature (idea → shipped) | `/ship` — the full A→Z run |
| A small next step, or continue mid-feature | `/start` |
| "Should we build this? what are the options?" (vague / new) | `/discover` |
| "Is this change safe?" before coding | `/challenge` |
| Prepare/track a piece of work (scope, plan, impact) | `/task` |
| A contested or non-trivial choice between roles | `/roundtable` |
| Look at a diff / code without building | `/review` |
| Check the project for inconsistency / drift | `/checkup` |
| Record a decision that was made | `/decide` |
| Hand finished work back to the owner to review / approve | `/handoff` |
| Just a question or explanation | no command — answer directly |

Rules of thumb:
- **Onboard first if the project is unset.** If `.kit/constitution.md` still holds placeholders (`<describe…>`), the kit was installed zero-question — offer `/onboard` before real work so the AI understands the project.
- **Don't over-serve.** A one-line fix or a plain question does not need `/ship`; offer the lightest path that fits. Reserve the heavy pipeline (and its gates) for real deliveries so the gates keep their meaning.
- **When in doubt, offer two.** e.g. *"Sounds like a whole feature — run `/ship`? Or just a quick fix with `/start`?"* Let the user pick.
- **Scale to the mode.** In `vibe`, keep the suggestion to a few words and move; in `standard`/`strict`, name the command and the gates it will run.
- `/ship` is the safe default front door: if the user reaches for it for something small, it right-sizes itself (see the triage in `/ship`).

# Evidence gate — don't claim done without proof

- **Never report a task as done, passing, or fixed without evidence.** State what you actually ran and its result.
- If tests exist: run them and quote the outcome (pass/fail counts). If they fail, say so with the output — do not hide it.
- If there are no tests: describe concretely how you verified the behavior (what you ran, what you observed).
- If a step was skipped or is unverified, say that plainly — don't imply it was checked.
- Skills that produce a review/verdict (code-review, test-design) must fill their **Test evidence** section; an empty evidence section means the gate is not satisfied.

## Required artifacts by risk (completeness)
Some change types are not "done" until a specific artifact exists — this is **not optional**, it is part of the gate:
- **Schema / data-shape change** → a **migration note AND a rollback step** (in the task / handoff). No migration note → not ready to ship.
- **Money, authentication, or personal-data (PII) touch** → a plain-language **business walkthrough AND a second review pass**. These carry real-world risk; a bare diff is not enough.
- **Destructive or irreversible operation** → the **reversible / backed-up step is written down** before it runs.

If a required artifact is missing, STOP and produce it — or state plainly why it does not apply — before shipping. This mirrors the task file's **Gate status** checklist; keep the two in sync.

# Conventions (generic profile)

- One way to do each thing. Pick a single approach for state, styling, data access, and routing; record it in the Decision Log and reuse it everywhere.
- **Naming:** intention-revealing (a reader understands without the body); no cryptic abbreviations. Follow the language's standard casing.
- Small, readable changes. Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep files where similar files already are. Don't invent a new top-level folder without recording why.
- No secrets in code. Use env/config.

## Roles
- **analyst** — Use FIRST when a request is vague, new, or comes from a non-technical person — before any planning, design, or code. Invoke for turning a fuzzy idea into a decision the founder can make. Not for step sequencing (planner) or structural/interface design (architect).
- **architect** — Use when a change affects structure, module boundaries, interfaces, data shape, or library choice. Invoke for system design, tradeoff decisions, and recording them in the Decision Log. Not for step sequencing (that is the planner).
- **db-admin** — Use when a change touches the database — schema, migrations, indexes, or a heavy query. Invoke for data-model design, safe reversible migrations, and query performance. Not for overall app structure (that's the architect) or feature code (implementer).
- **debugger** — Use when something is broken and the cause is unknown — a failing test, an error/stack trace, or wrong behavior. Invoke to reproduce, isolate, and find the root cause. Not for building the fix (that's the implementer) or confirming it works afterward (qa).
- **devops** — Use for release, build, deploy, backup, and environment or CI tasks. Invoke for shipping, operational safety, and infrastructure changes.
- **docs-manager** — Use when a code change leaves documentation stale — README, API docs, setup steps, or plain-language usage notes. Invoke to keep docs in sync with what the code actually does. Not for recording technical decisions (that's the Decision Log) or writing code.
- **git-manager** — Use when work needs to be committed, branched, or turned into a pull request. Invoke for a clean history, conventional commit messages, and PR hygiene. Not for writing the code itself (implementer) or reviewing it (reviewer).
- **implementer** — Use to write or edit code once a plan or decision exists. Invoke for building features, fixing bugs, and wiring things up while following existing patterns. The default worker for changing code.
- **orchestrator** — Use to start, resume, or route a task across roles. Invoke for coordinating a small team (1-3 roles), sequencing gates by mode, and plain-language checkpoints. Does not implement code in strict mode.
- **planner** — Use when a request needs breaking into steps, scope, and a definition of done BEFORE any design or code. Invoke for task decomposition, sequencing, and clarifying intent. Not for structural or interface decisions (that is the architect).
- **qa** — Use when a feature must be validated to actually work. Invoke for running tests, checking acceptance criteria, and reproducing behavior at runtime. Not static diff review (that is the reviewer).
- **reviewer** — Use immediately after code is written or changed, before finishing. Invoke for static review of a diff — correctness bugs, consistency with recorded decisions, style and security smells. Does not run the app (that is qa).

## Skills
- **code-review** — Use when there is a diff or changed code to check before finishing. Invoke for correctness bugs, consistency with recorded decisions, and style or security smells.
- **cross-review** — Use when a change is non-trivial or contested and needs more than one role's judgment before committing. Invoke to run a bounded roundtable — propose, challenge, revise across the relevant roles until it meets the agreed criteria or is escalated. Not for a solo quick fix (just build it).
- **decision-brief** — Use when a request is vague or new and a build decision has not been made yet. Invoke to turn a fuzzy idea into a founder-ready brief — the real problem, options with trade-offs, rough cost/risk, and the smallest slice worth building.
- **domain-model** — Use when the problem is framed but before design or code. Invoke to turn the business idea into an explicit domain model: the core entities in the founder's words, the states each moves through (a state machine), and the invariants that must always hold. Prevents whole classes of bugs — impossible states, illegal transitions, broken money/booking rules — by naming them up front.
- **git-workflow** — Use when starting a feature, opening a pull request, resolving a conflict, cutting a release, or shipping a hotfix. Invoke for the branching model, conventional commits, PR discipline, tagging, and hotfix flow the team follows.
- **guard-design** — Use when adding or changing hooks/guardrails (guard-shell, consistency-guard, blocklist, path boundaries). Invoke to design the BLOCK/WARN/ALLOW behavior and the bypass tests that prove it.
- **impact-map** — Use BEFORE a non-trivial change — do not edit code yet. Invoke to map every read/write of the affected data and all the routes, services, jobs, events, and tests that touch it, so a change doesn't silently break something the agent never saw.
- **pre-build-critique** — Use BEFORE writing or editing code for a new or non-trivial change. Invoke to challenge the change through fixed lenses — correctness, security & data, consistency, simplicity, reversibility — and record a go/adjust/stop verdict before building.
- **refactor** — Use when changing structure without changing behavior. Invoke to plan a safe refactor with impact analysis and a rollback path before touching code.
- **release-check** — Use before publishing or releasing (npm publish, tag, deploy). Invoke for a pre-release checklist covering version, changelog, tests, and a go/no-go verdict.
- **security-review** — Use when a change touches auth, secrets, shell/command execution, file access, or the guard/hooks. Invoke for a risk assessment with concrete exploit scenarios and fixes.
- **test-design** — Use when a task needs a QA or test gate. Invoke to design test cases and edge cases and to produce the exact commands that prove the behavior works.

## Commands
- `/challenge` — Run the pre-build critique — stress-test the planned change through fixed lenses and record a go/adjust/stop verdict before any code is written.
- `/checkup` — Audit the project against its Constitution and Decision Log, report drift in plain language, and offer to fix it.
- `/decide` — Append a technical decision to the Decision Log so future sessions stay consistent.
- `/discover` — Start here when the idea is still fuzzy. Reframes the request as a problem, weighs options, and produces a founder-ready decision brief BEFORE any planning or code.
- `/handoff` — Assemble a plain-language "human-control package" for a delivered piece of work — what was built, proof it works, what it touched and how to undo it, and what the owner must approve — so a non-technical owner can review, sign off, and stay in control. Runs at the end of /ship or on its own.
- `/onboard` — On first use, have the agent read your codebase and fill in the project's constitution — what it is, who it's for, what it must never do, and its stack — then confirm with you. Turns a zero-question install into an accurate setup without a cold interview.
- `/review` — Review the current changes for correctness and consistency with the recorded decisions before finishing.
- `/roundtable` — Get the relevant roles to debate a non-trivial change and converge on a decision BEFORE building — bounded rounds, then converge or escalate to you. Not for small fixes.
- `/ship` — Take a request from idea to shipped — discovery, critique, design, build, review, QA, and deploy — running the whole team pipeline and pausing only where you must decide. For a whole feature; use /start for a small next step.
- `/start` — Begin (or resume) work. Reads the project memory, plans the smallest next step, and builds it per the current mode.
- `/task` — Before building anything non-trivial, open a task record — scope, acceptance criteria, impact map, plan, and tests — so the work is prepared, traceable, and resumable next session. Use inside /ship or on its own.
