# Security Review skill

Assess the security impact of a change. Be concrete about how it could be abused.

Work from **[references/security-guide.md](references/security-guide.md)** — the STRIDE
categories, the OWASP Top 10 (2021) prioritized checklist (access-control first), the CWE
high-frequency patterns, and the ASVS depth cues — as your checklist, not memory.

This skill is the **human/agent logic review**. It does **not** replace CI scanners
(dependency CVE, secret leak, filesystem vulns). Point founders at **`ci-pipeline`** /
`.github/workflows/kit-security.yml` for those; quote scanner results in evidence when they
exist. For money/auth/PII (and related surfaces), the evidence gate **requires** this skill's
full output — scanners alone are not enough.

## Workflow
1. Map the **attack surface** the change adds or widens (inputs, commands run, files/paths read or written, network calls, secrets in scope). Walk it through **STRIDE** and the **OWASP Top 10** (§2–§3 of the reference).
2. For each risk, write a concrete **exploit scenario** (inputs/state → bad outcome), not a vague concern.
3. Check the guardrails: does the guard/hook actually block this, or is it only a markdown rule? Note gaps.
4. Note complementary **CI scanner** status (ran / skipped / not configured) — do not invent a green audit.
5. Recommend fixes and the tests that would prove them.

## Output format (required)
```md
## Attack surface
## Risks
| Severity | Risk | Evidence (file:line) | Exploit scenario | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
## Guardrail gaps
## CI scanners (audit · secrets · Trivy — ran / n/a)
## Recommended tests
## Verdict (safe to ship / fix first)
```
Position the guard honestly: hooks are damage-control, not isolation — the real boundary is the OS sandbox. An empty **Risks** table with no exploit scenarios on a money/auth/PII change **fails** this skill.
