For a vague or brand-new idea — especially from someone non-technical. The goal is a decision, not code.

1. Read `.kit/constitution.md` and `.kit/decisions.md` so the brief fits what's already decided.
2. Take the user's idea (from the argument or by asking) and **restate it as a problem, not a feature** — "You asked for X; is the real goal Y?" — and confirm in plain language.
3. If the direction isn't obvious (a fuzzy idea, no clear approach), **diverge first** with the **brainstorm** skill — generate many possibilities before narrowing — so the options below are the best of a wide set, not the first two that came to mind. Then hand it to the **analyst** role and produce a **decision brief** (see the decision-brief skill): the real problem, who it's for, 2–3 options with trade-offs, a rough (labelled) cost/risk estimate, the smallest slice worth building, the questions only you can answer, and a recommendation with what "done" looks like. Reason at **senior depth** (the **senior-reasoning** skill) — quantify the trade-offs, name the non-obvious risk, and steelman the recommendation rather than listing options at face value.
4. Scale to the mode: `vibe` = a 3–5 sentence brief; `standard` = the full written brief; `strict` = the full brief plus your sign-off recorded before any build.
5. **Checkpoint:** present the brief in plain language and get a decision. Only after that does planning/building start (hand off to `/start`).
6. Once the direction is chosen, and before design, **model the domain** (the domain-model skill): the core entities in the founder's words, the states each moves through, and the invariants that must always hold. This turns the decision into something the code can't violate — do it for anything with a lifecycle or a money/booking/inventory rule.
7. Append the decision (and why) to `.kit/decisions.md` so future sessions don't relitigate it.
