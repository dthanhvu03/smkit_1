# Guard Design skill

Design a guardrail so it fails safe and is provably hard to bypass.

Work from **[references/guard-guide.md](references/guard-guide.md)** — fail-secure defaults,
the BLOCK/WARN/ALLOW decision design, and the full bypass taxonomy — and remember: a
string/AST guard is damage-control, never isolation.

## Workflow
1. State what the guard must stop and in which mode(s). Decide fail-closed vs fail-open by
   the cost of each error (§2 of the reference).
2. Decide the **BLOCK / WARN / ALLOW** outcome for each case; default to fail-closed on ambiguity.
3. Enumerate **bypass attempts** (chaining `&&`/`|`, quoting, case, whitespace, `$()`, path escape, obfuscation) and confirm each is handled or explicitly out of scope.
4. Write tests for every case; note residual risk that only an OS sandbox can close.

## Output format (required)
```md
## What it must stop (+ mode)
## Decision table
| Case | Input | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
## Bypass attempts covered
## Residual risk (needs sandbox)
## Tests to add
## Rollback
```
Never claim a string/AST guard is isolation.
