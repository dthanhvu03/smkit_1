# Evidence gate — don't claim done without proof

- **Never report a task as done, passing, or fixed without evidence.** State what you actually ran and its result.
- If tests exist: run them and quote the outcome (pass/fail counts). If they fail, say so with the output — do not hide it.
- If there are no tests: describe concretely how you verified the behavior (what you ran, what you observed).
- If a step was skipped or is unverified, say that plainly — don't imply it was checked.
- Skills that produce a review/verdict (code-review, test-design) must fill their **Test evidence** section; an empty evidence section means the gate is not satisfied.
